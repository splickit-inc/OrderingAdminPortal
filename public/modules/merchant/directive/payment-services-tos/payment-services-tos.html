        <br/>
        2. ENSUREBILL AND THREATMETRIX SERVICES
    </p>
    <p>
        2.1 ENSUREBILL
        <br/>
        a. Description. TSYS EnsureBill Services, if made available by your
        Provider Partner, include enrolling you, submitting information to the Card
        Brands for updating, and providing updated account information to you as
        received by the Card Brands, subject to the terms and conditions of this
        agreement. An update means a match between a submitted card and the
        applicable Card Brand resulting in the provision of a new card number; a
        notification that the account has been closed; a new expiration date; or a
        “contact cardholder” message. If you elect to enroll in the EnsureBill
        Services you authorize ProPay to enroll you with the Card Brands to receive
        the EnsureBill Services and to provide information about you and your
        customers to ProPay’s service providers, including the Card Brand and
        ProPay’s processor, in order for ProPay to provide the EnsureBill Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        b. Limitations. You may use EnsureBill Services (and the data associated
        therewith) solely for updating cardholder information in order to complete
        your future pre-authorized transactions in accordance with the Card Brands
        and will not use the EnsureBill Services (nor the data associated
        therewith) for any other purpose, including use of data with transactions
        for a different card type (or in connection with the development of any
        other service or product). You must not request authorization or an update
        on accounts that have returned a response of “Closed Account” or submit
        inquiries for the EnsureBill Services on behalf of any other entity.
        <br/>
        c. Use outside of ProtectPay. For Cards not stored in ProPay’s ProtectPay

            database at least once every 180 calendar days;
        </li>
        <li>
            Submit requests only for those accounts with which you have an ongoing
            customer relationship that would require the use of the EnsureBill
            Services, e.g., subscription services, “express checkout” services,
            membership (club) services, or recurring payment services;
        </li>
        <li>
            Update your customer account database within five business days of
            receiving an update from us;
        </li>
        <li>

            properly incorporated into your customer database for utilization in
            future transactions;
        </li>
        <li>
            Correct erroneous account information within five business days of
            receipt of error notification from us or the Card Associations; and
        </li>
        <li>
            Correct operational errors within five business days of receipt of
            error notification from Bank, ProPay, or the Card Associations.
            <br/>
            ProPay will perform the tasks in subparagraphs (i) through (vi) above
            for Cards stored in ProtectPay.

    </ol>
    <p>
        2.2 THREATMETRIX
        <br/>
        a. Description. ThreatMetrix Services, if made available by your Provider
        Partner, include the device identification, device scoring, device
        reputation, and data analytics services provided by third party
        ThreatMetrix to you through your account. If you elect to use the
        ThreatMetrix Services, we grant you a non-exclusive, nontransferable,
        worldwide right to use the ThreatMetrix Services, and any other materials
        or intellectual property of ThreatMetrix provided to Client in connection
        with the ThreatMetrix Services (the “    <strong>ThreatMetrix Materials</strong>”), solely for your own internal
        business purposes, after implementation and configuration of our website by
        ThreatMetrix, and subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement.
        Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, we may modify
        the ThreatMetrix Services and our proprietary payment system without
        notice. Client shall not: (a) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or
        performance of the ThreatMetrix Services, our proprietary payment system,
        or the data contained therein; or (b) attempt to gain unauthorized access
        to the ThreatMetrix Services, our proprietary payment system, or its
        related systems or networks. You will provide such attribute information to
        us as may be necessary for us to provide to you the ThreatMetrix Services.
        You will also take such actions as may be legally and technically necessary
        to allow us and ThreatMetrix to collect the attribute information you
        decide to receive in connection with the ThreatMetrix Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        b. Use of Logo. Client may place on its website the “Protected by
        ThreatMetrix” logo solely in the form and under the use criteria provided
        by us or ThreatMetrix. No other use of the “Protected by ThreatMetrix” logo
        is permitted, and you shall have no right to otherwise copy, distribute,
        transmit, or transfer, such logo or any other mark of ThreatMetrix. All
        goodwill associated with the use of ThreatMetrix’s marks or logos inure to
        ThreatMetrix.
        <br/>
        c. Limitations. The ThreatMetrix Services analyze the activities and other
        attributes of a device used in a transaction, and provide information and a
        rating score based on the data analyzed and the business policies you
        define. The ThreatMetrix Services provide information as to whether the
        device contains attributes which correlate to a device used in a fraudulent
        transaction, but do not determine the eligibility of your customer (or any
        other individual) for credit. You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor
        ThreatMetrix intend that the reports generated by the ThreatMetrix Services
        (the “<strong>Device Reports</strong>”), or any ThreatMetrix Materials, be
        considered consumer reports subject to the federal Fair Credit Reporting
        Act (“FCRA”). You represent that you will not use the Device Reports (or
        any other data provided by ProPay or ThreatMetrix) for making credit
        eligibility decisions or for any other permissible purpose listed in
        section 604 of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681 b).

        provider and is qualified to handle Cardholder data (i.e., information
        associated with a Card, such as account number, expiration date, and CVV2)
        in connection with the Services. ProPay will comply with the Payment Card
        Industry Data Security Standards (“<strong>PCI DSS</strong>”) to the extent
        ProPay possesses or otherwise stores, processes, or transmits Cardholder
        data on your behalf. If you possess or otherwise store, process, or
        transmit Cardholder data, then you must comply with PCI DSS.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        3.2 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND POLICIES

        You further agree to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws,
        rules, and regulations (collectively, "<strong>Laws</strong>"). You also

        ascertain your compliance with any Rules, Laws, PCI DSS, or Policies. We
        may, within our sole discretion, suspend the Services for a reasonable
        period of time required to investigate suspicious or unusual activity, and
        we shall have no liability for any losses you may attribute to any
        suspension of funds disbursement. We may reverse Card transactions we deem
        to violate this agreement, the Laws, Rules, PCI DSS, or Policies, and you
        agree to reimburse us for any such reversal. If any terms of this agreement
        conflict with the Rules, including PCI DSS, the Rules will govern.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        3.3 THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS
        <br/>
        You may be using special services or software provided by a third party to
        assist you in processing transactions, including authorizations and
        settlements, or accounting functions. You must make sure that such third
        parties comply with the Rules (including PCI DSS) and Laws. You must notify
        Partner Provider if you use third party service providers. If there is
        unauthorized access to Cardholder data in the possession of you or your
        agents, you must immediately notify Partner Provider and cooperate with us
        regarding reasonable requests for information regarding the compromise.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        3.4 PROHIBITED PRACTICES
        <br/>
        You will not present for processing or credit, directly or indirectly, any
        transaction not originated as a result of a Card transaction directly
        between you and a Cardholder or any transaction you know or should know to
        be fraudulent or not authorized by the Cardholder. We will refer
        perpetrators of fraudulent transactions, in our discretion, to the
        appropriate law enforcement agency. You must not honor any Card that is
        expired or listed on a current Electronic Warning Bulletin file, regardless
        of whether authorization has been obtained. You must not request an ACH
        transfer that violates the Rules or Laws. You agree not to initiate any ACH
        debits or credits to or from a savings account, or a foreign bank or the
        branch of a foreign bank in a U.S. territory. The term foreign bank does
        not include: (i) A U.S. agency or branch of a foreign bank; and (ii) An
        insured bank organized under the laws of a U.S. territory. You may not
        split transactions into multiple Card transactions except where: (a)
        partial payment is entered on the transaction record and the balance of the
        transaction amount is paid in cash or by check at the time of transaction;
        or, (b) the amount represents an advance deposit in a Card transaction
        completed in accordance with this agreement and the Rules. You will not use
        the Services to accept amounts representing the refinancing of an existing
        uncollectible obligation, debt, or dishonored check of a Cardholder. You
        may not process transactions for, receive payments on behalf of, or (unless
        required by Law) redirect payments to a third party. You must not use the
        Service for high risk transactions or illegal activities, as per the
        Policies.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        3.5 USE OF TRADEMARKS
        <br/>
        The Card Brands are the sole and exclusive owners of their marks and your
        use of their marks must comply with the Rules. We are the sole and
        exclusive owner of our marks and your use of our marks will fully comply
        with our policies and instructions. At any time we may prohibit your use of
        the marks or require changes to your use of the marks as we deem necessary
        or appropriate. Your right to use our marks and the Card Brand marks will
        cease upon termination of this agreement and you agree not to contest the
        ownership of the marks for any reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        4. ACCEPTING PAYMENT
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        4.1 CARD ACCEPTANCE
        <br/>
        You will honor, without discrimination, any valid Card properly tendered by
        a person asserting to be the person in whose name the Card is issued (“    <strong>Cardholder</strong>”). Terms specific to American Express cards are
        set forth in section 5. You may elect not to accept Visa and/or MasterCard
        branded debit cards, but you must provide ProPay with prior written notice
        of such election. You will properly disclose to the Cardholder, at the time
        of the Card transaction, your name, return policy, and other limitations
        you may have on accepting returned merchandise. Your refund polices for
        purchases made with a Card must be at least as favorable as your refund
        policy for purchases made with any other form of payment. Our name will
        appear in conjunction with your name on Cardholders’ statements. You will
        not accept any payments from a Cardholder relating to previous charges for
        merchandise or services, and if you receive such payments, you will
        promptly remit them to us.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        4.2 CARD AUTHORIZATION
        <br/>
        No later than 72 hours from the time you initiate a transaction, but prior
        to completing it, you will request an authorization for the transaction
        using equipment meeting specifications determined by ProPay. This
        authorization request must include your name and account identifier, the
        Card expiration date, the ZIP code of the customer’s billing address, and
        the total amount of the transaction, including taxes. ProPay may also
        require additional information in your request, such as: (a) CVV2 code or
        the equivalent; (b) a brief description of the goods or services involved;
        (c) the transaction authorization number; and, (d) if applicable, adjacent
        to the signature line, a notation that all sales are final. When
        authorization is obtained, you will be deemed to warrant the identity of
        the customer as the Cardholder. Authorizations are not a guarantee of
        acceptance or payment of a transaction and do not waive any provision of
        this agreement, or otherwise validate a fraudulent transaction or a
        transaction involving the use of an expired Card. We may refuse to
        authorize any transaction.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        4.3 SALES TRANSMITTALS
        <br/>
        You will retain a copy of the sales transmittal for the completed
        transaction in accordance with the Rules for 25 months or such longer
        period as the Rules may require. Within three business days of our request,
        you will produce copies of sales transmittals and other transaction
        evidence, otherwise ProPay will have chargeback rights with respect to such
        transactions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        4.4 RECURRING TRANSACTIONS
        <br/>
        You must obtain the Cardholder’s prior written consent for recurring
        transactions, including a description of the product and the frequency and
        duration of the recurring charge, and notify the Cardholder that he or she
        may cancel recurring billing charges at any time. You must retain evidence
        of such written consent for 24 months from the date you submit the last
        recurring billing charge. You will honor any Cardholder cancellation, and
        if this agreement is terminated for any reason, you will, at your own cost,
        advise all Cardholders to whom you submit recurring billing charges that
        you no longer accept the Card for amounts owed.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        4.5 ACH PROCESSING
        <br/>
        To enable you to make and accept ACH payments, you authorize us to
        originate credit or debit records for the purpose of a funds transfer (“    <strong>Entries</strong>”) into the ACH network. We will use reasonable
        efforts to originate Entries on your behalf in accordance with this
        agreement. You must only submit Entries for bona fide transactions with
        your customers made in the ordinary course of business in accordance with
        this agreement, the Rules, and Laws. You shall obtain and maintain
        appropriate authorizations in accordance with the Rules from each of your
        customers for each ACH transaction. All disputes between you and any of
        your customers relating to any ACH transaction must be resolved between you
        and that customer. If ProPay receives any notice of an ACH dispute or NACHA
        inquiry, we will forward such notice directly to you. ProPay bears no
        financial responsibility for any disputed transaction. You must maintain an
        unauthorized return rate, as described in the NACHA Regulations, below 0.5%
        of originating debits.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        5. AMERICAN EXPRESS
    </p>
    <p>
        Important Note: The following sections apply only if you accept American
        Express Cards. If there is a conflict between any of the following sections
        and any other section of this agreement as it applies to American Express
        Cards, the following sections will govern.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        5.1 CUSTOMER SERVICE INFORMATION
        <br/>
        You must maintain customer service information that is readily available
        for review by American Express Cardholders transacting with you. The

        5.2 THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY.
        <br/>
        You understand and covenant that you are not a third-party beneficiary
        under our agreement with American Express, including all schedules and
        exhibits, or the American Express Rules. You acknowledge and agree that
        American Express is a third-party beneficiary under this agreement between
        you and ProPay. This means American Express has the right, but not the
        obligation, to enforce the terms of this agreement against you.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        5.3 AUTHORIZATIONS
        <br/>
        You authorize us to submit American Express Card transactions to, and
        receive payment from, American Express on your behalf. You authorize us to
        disclose Card transaction data and data about you to American Express, its
        affiliates, agents, subcontractors, and employees, and further authorize
        these entities to use such information to perform services, operate and
        promote the American Express network, perform analytics and create reports,
        and for any other lawful business purpose, including as described in the
        American Express Rules. You authorize American Express to use your name,
        address, and website address in any media.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        5.4 AMERICAN EXPRESS ARBITRATION
        <br/>
        Any dispute between you and American Express shall be resolved on an
        individual (not class) basis by binding arbitration in accordance with the
        rules of the American Arbitration Association or JAMS. You will be
        responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including
        filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount
        of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in
        court. American Express will be responsible for any additional arbitration
        fees. American Express will not elect arbitration for any claim you
        properly file in a small claims court so long as such claim is pending only
        in that court.

        6. DISPUTES
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        6.1 YOUR DUTY TO MONITOR
        <br/>
        ProPay will not, and has no obligation to, confirm the validity of the
        recipient or the underlying transaction pursuant to which funds are
        transferred. We assume no liability for any unauthorized transfer request
        and the attendant transfer of funds, unless and until we receive
        appropriate and timely notice by you of the unauthorized transfer requests.
        You must promptly and consistently inspect your transaction history.
        Immediately report any possible errors.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        6.2 DISPUTES, INQUIRIES, AND CHARGEBACKS
        <br/>
        All disputes between you and any of your customers relating to any ACH
        transaction must be resolved between you and that customer. If ProPay
        receives any notice of an ACH dispute or NACHA inquiry, we will forward
        such notice directly to you. Working with Provider Partner, we will handle
        Card Brand inquiries about your card transactions, in addition to disputes
        between you and a customer involving card payment transactions. Based on
        customer disputes we may reverse Card transactions (“    <strong>chargebacks</strong>”), and we will offset the value of such
        chargebacks from monies owed to you. You must not reenter or reprocess any
        Card transaction that has been charged back, but instead allow the
        chargeback process to proceed to its conclusion as described in each Card
        Brand’s Rules. If you disagree with a chargeback, you may request a
        chargeback reversal within the applicable Card Brand’s timeline in its
        Rules. "<strong>Excessive Activity</strong>" means: chargebacks in excess
        of .50% of the transaction ratio of your Card transactions; or, chargebacks
        in excess of .50% of the transaction ratio of the dollar amount of your
        Card transactions; or, returns in excess of 3% of the transaction ratio of
        your Card transactions; or, denied transactions in excess of 5% of the
        transaction ratio of your Card transactions. The existence of Excessive
        Activity will be a breach of this agreement and may result in action as we
        deem necessary, including, but not limited to, termination or suspension of
        processing privileges or creation or maintenance of a reserve. We may
        revoke or reverse any credit given to you where: (i) the Card transaction
        was not made in compliance with this agreement and the Laws, Rules, and
        Policies; (ii) the Cardholder disputes liability to us for any reason,
        including but not limited to those chargeback rights enumerated in the
        Rules; (iii) the Card transaction was not directly between you and the
        Cardholder; or (iv) a deposit to you was made erroneously.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        6.3 REFUND CREDITS
        <br/>
        You will not submit a credit relating to any Card transaction not
        originally submitted to us, nor will you submit a credit that exceeds the
        amount of the original Card transaction.

        7. CONFIDENTIALITY &amp; DATA SECURITY
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        7.1 CONFIDENTIALITY
        <br/>
        You must retain in strictest confidence all information and data belonging
        to or relating to our business, and will safeguard such information and
        data by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable amount
        of care, that you use to protect your own confidential information.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        7.2 DATA SECURITY
        <br/>
        You must keep secure all systems and media containing account, Cardholder,
        or transaction information (physical or electronic) and destroy in a manner
        that will render the data unreadable all such media that is no longer
        necessary or appropriate to store. If you store Cardholder account numbers,
        expiration dates, and other personal Cardholder data in a database, you
        must follow Card Brand guidelines on securing such data. You may not retain
        or store magnetic stripe or CVV2, CVC2, or CID data after authorization.
        You shall maintain industry "best practices" regarding continuity
        procedures and systems to ensure security of Cardholder account information
        in the event of a disruption, disaster, or failure of your respective data
        storage system and/or facility. You agree to display your consumer privacy
        policy on your website as well as your security method for transmission of
        Cardholder data.

        8.2 DEPOSIT OF FUNDS TO MERCHANT POOL ACCOUNT
        <br/>
        Our sponsor banks will deposit to the non-interest bearing pooled account
        titled in the name of our sponsor bank for the benefit of all ProPay
        merchants (“<strong>Merchant Pool Account</strong>”) all amounts of Card
        and ACH transactions complying with the terms of this agreement and the
        Rules. We will instruct our sponsor bank to move funds owed to you from the
        Merchant Pool Account to an account you designate with Provider Partner.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        8.3 ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER AGREEMENT
        <br/>
        You authorize ProPay to initiate, process, transmit, and settle through our
        sponsor bank ACH debits or credits to the account you specify with Provider
        Partner (“<strong>Designated Account</strong>”). Your authorization will
        remain in effect after termination of this agreement and until ProPay has
        received written notice terminating this authorization and all your
        obligations to ProPay have been paid in full. You irrevocably authorize us
        to immediately debit the Designated Account for the amounts of any
        chargebacks, ACH returns, fines, losses, and costs we may incur because of
        your use of the Services. You may change the Designated Account, but no
        more than once every 90 days, and must promptly notify Provider Partner of
        any changes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        8.4 RESERVE
        <br/>
        ProPay may, in its reasonable discretion, establish a reserve if it
        believes there is a risk of potential chargebacks, returns, or any other
        risk or liability associated with your use of the Services or to ensure
        current or future payment owed to ProPay. We will provide you with notice
        of the reserve and the terms of the reserve. ProPay may require that a
        certain portion of your transaction proceeds be held by us in reserve for a
        certain period of time, or that you make a lump sum payment for the
        reserve. ProPay may change the terms of the reserve at any time by
        providing you with notice of the new terms. ProPay has the right to use
        your funds in the Merchant Pool Account or funds otherwise owed to you to
        establish, increase, or maintain funds in reserve. We may hold a reserve as
        long as we deem necessary to mitigate risks associated with your
        transactions. You understand and agree that if you are required to
        establish a reserve, you have an obligation under this agreement to
        maintain at all times the balance in the reserve set by ProPay. ProPay may,
        without notice, apply funds designated as reserves against any outstanding
        amounts owed to us under this agreement. ProPay may also debit the reserve
        to exercise its rights under this agreement to collect any amounts due to
        us including, without limitation, rights of set-off and recoupment. You
        agree that you are liable for all obligations associated with your use of
        the Services even after the release of any reserve. You will not be
        entitled to a return of any sums remaining in reserve for up to 270 days
        following termination of your use of the Services.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        8.5 ADJUSTMENTS
        <br/>
        All transactions and deposits are subject to our audit and final
        verification, and may be adjusted for inaccuracies. All credits provided to
        you are provisional and subject to chargebacks and adjustments in
        accordance with the Rules, whether or not a transaction is charged back by
        the Card issuer.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        8.6 TAXES &amp; IRS REPORTING
        <br/>
        To comply with IRS 1099-K reporting requirements, we may be required to
        file a form 1099-K with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We may
        collect federal backup withholding upon transaction settlement, on behalf
        of the IRS, from you if you do not supply your legal name, SSN or EIN, or
        if you fail to respond to a request from us to verify the same.
